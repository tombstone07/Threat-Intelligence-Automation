### **3.2 Threat Intelligence Correlation**
The following IPs were found in **Threat Intelligence Feeds (AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX)**.

#### **üö® Malicious IPs Identified**
| IP Address       | AbuseIPDB | VirusTotal | AlienVault OTX | Threat Type |
|-----------------|----------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **45.133.1.126** | Clean   | **Malware (Kaspersky, CyRadar, MalwareURL)** | **Found in Blacklists** | **High-Risk (Malware Activity)** |
| **20.50.80.209** | **Blacklisted** | **Flagged as Malicious** | **Found in Malware Feeds** | **Critical (Compromised Server)** |
| **40.83.240.146** | Suspicious | No Reports | Requires Review | **Medium (Possible Suspicious Activity)** |

#### **Key Observations**
- **45.133.1.126** is linked to **malware distribution** and **flagged by multiple security vendors**.  
- **20.50.80.209** appears in **multiple blacklists**, indicating it is likely **involved in cybercrime activity**.  
- **40.83.240.146** does not have enough threat intelligence data but has been marked as **suspicious**.  

üîé **Implication:** These **IP addresses may be communicating with infected machines**, or **attempting reconnaissance/scanning activities** within the network.

---

### **3.3 Security Threats Identified**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Malware Communication (C2 Traffic)**  
- The flagged **malicious IPs** could be **command-and-control (C2) servers** used for **remotely controlling compromised systems**.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Unauthorized SMB Access (Lateral Movement)**  
- **High SMB2 traffic** could mean an attacker is **moving laterally inside the network** using file-sharing exploits.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Exfiltration via DNS Tunneling**  
- **Unusual DNS activity** suggests **possible data exfiltration** through **DNS tunneling techniques**.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Phishing & Credential Theft**  
- If malicious **HTTP requests** are detected, this could indicate an attacker is **trying to steal user credentials**.

---

### **3.4 Security Recommendations**
#### **üî¥ Immediate Actions**
‚úîÔ∏è **Block the following IP addresses** at the **firewall level**:
   - `45.133.1.126`
   - `20.50.80.209`  
‚úîÔ∏è **Monitor outbound connections** to flagged IPs.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Investigate SMB and LDAP traffic** for unauthorized access attempts.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Enable logging for DNS requests** to detect **malicious domain lookups**.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Enforce strict network segmentation** to **isolate sensitive systems** from potential threats.  

#### **üü° Long-Term Security Measures**
‚úÖ **Implement SIEM Monitoring**  
- Use **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** tools to **correlate security logs** and detect anomalies.  

‚úÖ **Endpoint Protection**
